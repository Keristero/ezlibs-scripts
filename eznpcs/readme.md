# eznpcs lib

Automatically creates NPC's for your server based on objects you add to the map in Tiled.

You can create branching dialogue trees for conversations with NPCs all from the map editor, and if you want you can add scripted events for more complicated interactions.

You can create paths using waypoints in the map editor which the NPCs will follow, with optional wait times and random path selection.

## Setup
add objects to your map with Type=`NPC` on an object layer above the tile layer where you want the NPC to spawn.

### NPC Type
- Custom properties:
    - Asset Name: string
        - name of npc tilesheet from `yourserver/assets/ezlibs-assets/eznpcs/sheet`
        - for example `heel-navi-exe4_black` (no file extension)
    - Direction: string
        - see the section on [`Directions`](#Directions).
    - Dialogue Type: string
        - by including this property, this npc will become interactable
        - see the section on [`Dialogues`](#Dialogues).
        - all the other dialogue properties can also be used here
    - Next Waypoint 1: string
        - by including this property, this npc will follow waypoints
        - Indicates the first waypoint that the npc should move to
        - see the section on [`Waypoints`](#Waypoints)
    - Dont Face Player: boolean
        - by including this property and setting it to true, the npc will not turn to face the player when talked to.



### Dialogues
any object can be a dialogue, you can use these custom properties to define what will happen next in the conversation when the dialogue is reached
- Custom properties:
    - Dialogue Type: string
        - `first`
            - this dialogue will make the NPC say the first `Text #` custom property, usually `Text 1`
            - after `Text 1` is finished, 
        - `random`
            - this dialogue will choose a random `Text #` custom property to say, it might be `Text 1`, `Text 2`, `Text 5`, etc.
            - If there is a `Next #` property with a matching number, that dialogue will be triggered next, otherwise it will default to `Next 1`
        - `question`
            - prompts the player to choose yes or no, with `Text 1` as the prompt text
            - afterwards the dialogues `Next 1` or `Next 2` will be triggered, matching the player's choice.
        - `before`
            - compares current time against [`Date`](#Date) custom property
            - if the current time is before `Date`, `Text 1` will be displayed, otherwise `Text 2`, it will go to the respective `Next x` dialogue node afterwards
        - `after`
            - same as `before`, checks if current time is after `Date`
        - `itemcheck`
            - checks to see if the player has an item specified by the `Required Item` custom property
            - if the `Required Amount`(number) custom property exists, the player will need that many of the item, otherwise they only need 1
            - if `Required Item` is set to `money`, the player's money will be compared instead of an item.
            - if `Take Item`(boolean) is set to `true`, the items/money will also be taken from the player after passing this check.

        - `none`
            - usually used with `Event Name`, no dialogue, but the event will still be triggered
            
    - Text 1: string
        - (numbered, you can also include, 2, 3, 4 etc. up to 10)
        - Text that will be spoken by NPCS who have this dialogue
    - Next 1: object
        - (numbered, you can also include, 2, 3, 4 etc. up to 10)
        - ID of the next dialogue to activate after the corresponding Text is spoken / chosen
    - Event Name: string
        - Name of event to activate when this dialogue starts, events can be added in your eznpcs entry script, see [`Dialogue Events`](#DialogueEvents) for details.
    - Mugshot: string
        - Override the speaking bot's mugshot with another one for this dialogue node.
        - for example, even though `prog` is speaking, we can make it display Bass' mugshot by setting `Mugshot` to `bass`
        - There is a special value `player` which will get the mugshot of the player talking to the NPC, useful for back and forth conversations

### Waypoints
any object can be a waypoint, you can use these custom properties to define what the NPC will do once it reaches said object.
- Custom properties:
    - Dialogue Type: string
    - Waypoint Type: string
        - `first`
            - after reaching this waypoint, the NPC will head to the waypoint referenced by the first `Next Waypoint #` custom property, usually `Next Waypoint 1`
        - `random`
            - after reaching this waypoint, the next one will be selected from a random `Next Waypoint #` custom property.
        - `before`
            - compares current time against [`Date`](#Date) custom property
            - if the current time is before `Date`, `Next Waypoint 1` will be next, otherwise `Next Waypoint 2` will be.
        - `after`
            - same as `before`, checks if current time is after `Date`
    - Wait Time: int
        - time in seconds to wait before moving to next waypoint
    - Direction: string
        - direction to face while waiting
        - see the section on [`Directions`](#Directions).
    - Waypoint Event: string
        - coming soon

### Date
the `Date` custom property can be used for time based conditions on Dialogue nodes and Waypoints
the format is a super duper basic cron like format. there are 6 numbers seperated by spaces for each part of the date string
`second` `minute` `hour` `day` `month` `year`
you can hardcode a specific date and time like this
`0 0 13 1 1 2000` (1pm on first of january year 2000)
or you can use wildcards which will always behave as the current time for that column
`30 * * * * *` (30 seconds through the current minute, today)


### Interact Relay
- any object with the custom property `Interact Relay` (object) that is interacted with will start a conversation with the NPC that it is referencing
- useful for starting conversations with NPCS that are behind objects like counters

### DialogueEvents
- events added through the eznpcs entry script will be activated when a player reaches a dialogue during a conversation with a matching `Event Name` custom property
- the action of the event is a callback which allows for any and all custom interactions.
- callback parameters:
    - npc
        - (table) information about the NPC who the player is conversing with
    - player_id
        - (string) id of the player who engaged the npc in conversation
    - dialogue
        - (table) information about the dialogue object
    - relay_object
        - (table) information about the relay object which the player started their conversation with the NPC through (nil if the player did not start conversing using a relay object)
- expected return types
    - nil
        - will end the conversation
    - table
        - table with `wait_for_response` (bool) and `id` (string)
        - `wait_for_response` should be true if you sending any messages to the player in this event.
        - `id` should be the object id of the next dialogue you want to trigger after this one (if any)
```lua
local some_event = {
    name="Drink Gravy",
    action=function (npc,player_id,dialogue,relay_object)
        local player_mugshot = Net.get_player_mugshot(player_id)
        Net.play_sound_for_player(player_id,sfx.recover)
        Net.message_player(player_id,"\x01...\x01mmm gravy yum",player_mugshot.texture_path,player_mugshot.animation_path)
        local next_dialouge_options = {
            wait_for_response=true,
            id=dialogue.custom_properties["Next 1"]
        }
        return next_dialouge_options
    end
}
eznpcs.add_event(some_event)
```

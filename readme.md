# eznpcs
Automatically creates NPC's for your server based on objects you add to the map in Tiled.

You can create branching dialogue trees for conversations with NPCs all from the map editor, and if you want you can add scripted events for more complicated interactions.

You can create paths using waypoints in the map editor which the NPCs will follow, with optional wait times and random path selection.

## Setup
add objects to your map with Type=`NPC` on an object layer above the tile layer where you want the NPC to spawn.

### NPC Type
Custom properties:
- `Asset Name` string
    - name of npc tilesheet from `yourserver/assets/ezlibs-assets/eznpcs/sheet`
    - for example `heel-navi-exe4_black` (no file extension)
- `Direction` string
    - see the section on [`Directions`](#Directions).
- `Dialogue Type` string
    - by including this property, this npc will become interactable
    - see the section on [`Dialogues`](#Dialogues).
    - all the other dialogue properties can also be used here
- `Next Waypoint 1` object
    - by including this property, this npc will follow waypoints
    - Indicates the first waypoint that the npc should move to
    - see the section on [`Waypoints`](#Waypoints)



### Dialogues
any object can be a dialogue, you can use these custom properties to define what will happen next in the conversation when the dialogue is reached
Custom properties:
- `Dialogue Type` string
    - `first`
        - this dialogue will make the NPC say the first `Text #` custom property, usually `Text 1`
        - after `Text 1` is finished, 
    - `random`
        - this dialogue will choose a random `Text #` custom property to say, it might be `Text 1`, `Text 2`, `Text 5`, etc.
        - If there is a `Next #` property with a matching number, that dialogue will be triggered next, otherwise it will default to `Next 1`
    - `question`
        - prompts the player to choose yes or no, with `Text 1` as the prompt text
        - afterwards the dialogues `Next 1` or `Next 2` will be triggered, matching the player's choice.
    - `before`
        - compares current time against [`Date`](#Date) custom property
        - if the current time is before `Date`, `Text 1` will be displayed, otherwise `Text 2`, it will go to the respective `Next x` dialogue node afterwards
    - `after`
        - same as `before`, checks if current time is after `Date`
    - `none`
        - usually used with `Event Name`, no dialogue, but the event will still be triggered
        
- `Text 1` string
    - (numbered, you can also include, 2, 3, 4 etc. up to 10)
    - Text that will be spoken by NPCS who have this dialogue
- `Next 1` object
    - (numbered, you can also include, 2, 3, 4 etc. up to 10)
    - ID of the next dialogue to activate after the corresponding Text is spoken / chosen
- `Event Name` string
    - Name of event to activate when this dialogue starts, events can be added in your eznpcs entry script, see [`Dialogue Events`](#DialogueEvents) for details.
- `Mugshot` string
    - Override the speaking bot's mugshot with another one for this dialogue node.
    - for example, even though `prog` is speaking, we can make it display Bass' mugshot by setting `Mugshot` to `bass`
    - There is a special value `player` which will get the mugshot of the player talking to the NPC, useful for back and forth conversations

### Waypoints
any object can be a waypoint, you can use these custom properties to define what the NPC will do once it reaches said object.
Custom properties:
- `Dialogue Type` string
- `Waypoint Type` string
    - `first`
        - after reaching this waypoint, the NPC will head to the waypoint referenced by the first `Next Waypoint #` custom property, usually `Next Waypoint 1`
    - `random`
        - after reaching this waypoint, the next one will be selected from a random `Next Waypoint #` custom property.
    - `before`
        - compares current time against [`Date`](#Date) custom property
        - if the current time is before `Date`, `Next Waypoint 1` will be next, otherwise `Next Waypoint 2` will be.
    - `after`
        - same as `before`, checks if current time is after `Date`
- `Wait Time` number
    - time in seconds to wait before moving to next waypoint
- `Direction` string
    - direction to face while waiting
    - see the section on [`Directions`](#Directions).
- `Waypoint Event` string
    - coming soon

### Date
the `Date` custom property can be used for time based conditions on Dialogue nodes and Waypoints
the format is a super duper basic cron like format. there are 6 numbers seperated by spaces for each part of the date string

`second` `minute` `hour` `day` `month` `year`

you can hardcode a specific date and time like this:

`0 0 13 1 1 2000` (1pm on first of january year 2000)

or you can use wildcards which will always behave as the current time for that column

`30 * * * * *` (30 seconds through the current minute, today)


### Interact Relay
- any object with the custom property `Interact Relay` (object) that is interacted with will start a conversation with the NPC that it is referencing
- useful for starting conversations with NPCS that are behind objects like counters

### DialogueEvents
- you can add custom logic for dialogues using `eznpcs.add_event(event_object)`
- eznpcs will automatically try and load the file `/server/scripts/events/eznpcs_events.lua` for this purpose, so create that file and add events from there
- loaded events will activated when a player reaches a dialogue during a conversation with a matching `Event Name` custom property
- the action of the event is a callback which allows for any and all custom interactions.
- callback parameters:
    - `npc` table
        - information about the NPC who the player is conversing with
    - `player_id` string
        - id of the player who engaged the npc in conversation
    - `dialogue` table
        - information about the dialogue object
    - `relay_object` table
        - information about the relay object which the player started their conversation with the NPC through
        - nil if the player did not start conversing using a relay object
- expected return types
    - nil
        - will end the conversation
    - table
        - table with `wait_for_response` (bool) and `id` (string)
        - `wait_for_response` should be true if you sending any messages to the player in this event.
        - `id` should be the object id of the next dialogue you want to trigger after this one (if any)

*Here is an example dialogue event where a sound effect plays and the player enjoys gravy*
```lua
local sfx = {
    recover='/server/assets/ezlibs-assets/sfx/recover.ogg',
}
local some_event = {
    name="Drink Gravy",
    action=function (npc,player_id,dialogue,relay_object)
        local player_mugshot = Net.get_player_mugshot(player_id)
        Net.play_sound_for_player(player_id,sfx.recover)
        Net.message_player(player_id,"\x01...\x01mmm gravy yum",player_mugshot.texture_path,player_mugshot.animation_path)
        local next_dialouge_options = {
            wait_for_response=true,
            id=dialogue.custom_properties["Next 1"]
        }
        return next_dialouge_options
    end
}
eznpcs.add_event(some_event)
```
if you add this example to `/server/scripts/events/eznpcs_events.lua` you should see it load when you start the server
### Waypoint Events

# ezmystery
lets you place mystery data objects on your maps to give players key items and money

## Setup
add objects to your map with Type=`Mystery Datum` on an object layer above the tile layer where you want the Mystery data to spawn

### Mystery Dataum
Custom properties:
- `Type` string
    - one of these three options
        - money
        - keyitem
        - random
- `Amount` number
    - the amount of money to give the player
- `Name` string
    - name of the key item to give the player (the item will be created automatically by ezmystery if it does not exist)
- `Description` string
    - description of the key item to give the player, if keyitems with the same name already exist, all of them will be updated with the new description
- `Next #`: object
    - You can have up to 9 of these, named `Next 1`, `Next 2` etc
    - if using the `random` type, the reward will be selected from a `Mystery Option` type object; randomly selected from a `Next #` property

### Mystery Option
Custom properties:
- (all the same properties as mystery datum, but these are exclusively for providing random rewards as they will be removed from the map when the server loads)

# ezmemory
provides easyish saving and loading of things, this library is only interacted with through lua

you can clear all information stored by ezmemory by deleting the files in the `/server/memory/` folder that we created during setup

as long as you use the ezmemory functions (as opposed to the built in equivilants) ezmemory will automatically persist player money, items, key items, and any other table data you want.

note that if you create an item which is not a key item, it will not show up anywhere, this can still be useful for your own custom scripts.

```lua
local new_item_id = ezmemory.create_or_update_item(item_name,item_description,is_key)
```
- if an item with is_key is given to a player it will show in keyitems
- if an item with the same name already exists; the details will be updated, this wont update in the players key items until the player reconnects

```lua
local new_item_count = ezmemory.give_player_item(player_id, item_name, amount)
```
- will return `nil` if the item you attempted to give the player has not been created using `ezmemory.create_or_update_item`

```lua
local item_count = ezmemory.count_player_item(player_id, item_name)
```

```lua
ezmemory.set_player_money(player_id, money)
```

```lua
local success = ezmemory.spend_player_money(player_id, amount)
```
- spends the specified amount of money if the player has enough
- returns `true` if the player had enough money, otherwise returns `false`

these have been the main functions, but there are more to see in the ezmemory.lua file

# ezencounters
handle enemy encounters, and trigger random ones from a table for each map

create a lua file for each map with the same name as the tiled map (`default.lua` for example)
and put the file into the `server/encounters/` (create this folder if it does not exist)

encounter options:
- name (string)
    - if provided, this name can be used to trigger encounters by name, the encounter still needs to be added to a encounter table
- path (string)
    - path to the main encounter file, usually this will be the same as in the examples, but if you want to create your own .zip you can specify it here, note you will need to copy/modify the code from the provided ezencounters.zip

here is an example of the contents, in this case just one potential encounter layout with some mettaurs and a champy

```lua
local encounter1 = {
    path="/server/assets/ezlibs-assets/ezencounters/ezencounters.zip",
    weight=10,
    enemies = {
        {name="Mettaur",rank=1},
        {name="Champy",rank=1},
    },
    positions = {
        {0,0,0,0,0,2},
        {0,0,0,0,1,0},
        {0,0,0,1,0,0}
    },
    results_callback = give_result_awards --function (player_id,encounter_info,stats)
}

return {
    minimum_steps_before_encounter=400,
    encounter_chance_per_step=0.01,
    encounters={encounter1}
}
```

here is another example with every optional field included
```lua
local encounter1 = {
    name="example encounter"
    path="/server/assets/ezlibs-assets/ezencounters/ezencounters.zip",
    weight=10,
    enemies = {
        {name="BigBrute",rank=1,max_hp=500,starting_hp=500,nickname="Doggie"},
        {name="Gunner",rank=1},
    },
    positions = {
        {0,0,0,0,0,2},
        {0,0,0,0,1,0},
        {0,0,0,0,0,2}
    },
    tiles = {
        {1,1,9,9,1,1},
        {1,1,9,9,1,1},
        {1,1,9,9,1,1}
    },
    teams = {
        {2,2,0,0,1,1},
        {2,2,0,0,1,1},
        {2,2,0,0,1,1}
    },
    obstacles = {
        {name="RockCube"},
    },
    obstacle_positions = {
        {0,0,1,1,0,0},
        {0,0,1,1,0,0},
        {0,0,1,1,0,0}
    },
    player_positions = {
        {0,0,0,0,0,0},
        {1,0,0,0,0,0},
        {0,0,0,0,0,0}
    },
    freedom_mission={
        turn_count=5,
        player_can_flip=true
    },
    music={
        path="bcc_battle.mid"
    }
}

return {
    minimum_steps_before_encounter=50,
    encounter_chance_per_step=0.1,
    encounters={encounter1}
}
```

you can also specify a results calback (as seen above) which will be called at the end of the battle;
here we are requiring ezmemory in order to give the player some reward monies for winning the battle

```lua
local ezmemory = require('scripts/ezlibs-scripts/ezmemory')

local sfx = {
    item_get='/server/assets/ezlibs-assets/sfx/item_get.ogg'
}

local give_result_awards = function (player_id,encounter_info,stats)
    -- stats = { health: number, score: number, time: number, ran: bool, emotion: number, turns: number, npcs: { id: String, health: number }[] }
    -- set the player emotion if they left the battle with full sync (1)
    if stats.emotion == 1 then
        Net.set_player_emotion(player_id, stats.emotion)
    else
        Net.set_player_emotion(player_id, 0)
    end
    -- set the player health to whatever they finished the battle with
    Net.set_player_health(player_id,stats.health)
    if stats.ran then
        return -- no rewards for wimps
    end
    local reward_monies = (stats.score*50)
    ezmemory.spend_player_money(player_id,-reward_monies) -- spending money backwards gives money
    Net.message_player(player_id,"Got $"..reward_monies.."!")
    Net.play_sound_for_player(player_id,sfx.item_get)
end
```

## Radius Encounters
You can create an object with type `Radius Encounter` which will trigger an encounter the first time a player reaches it.
Custom Properties:
- `Name` (string) name of the encounter (from encounter table) to activate
- `Path` (string) if name is not specified, you can trigger an encounter with a mob package zip by specifying it's path
- `Once` (boolean) if true, this encounter will never appear again for this player after they beat it


# ezweather
lets you control the weather per map

## Setup
add some extra properties to your map file if you want to

```lua
ezweather.start_rain_in_area(area_id)
```
- if you specify a `Rain Song` custom property on your map, it will play while it is raining

```lua
ezweather.start_snow_in_area(area_id)
```
- if you specify a `Snow Song` custom property on your map, it will play while it is snowing

```lua
ezweather.clear_weather_in_area(area_id)
```
- restores the original foreground and `Song`

# ezfarms
a large plugin which adds a harvest moon style farming system to your server. but it is a pain to set up so disable it by removing it from the start of main.lua (and the plugin list in main.lua)

# custom plugin
If you need to add your own logic that interacts with ezlibs outside of dialogue events / encounter results - 
create this file `/server/scripts/ezlibs-custom/custom.lua` and you can add your own custom plugin which will be automatically added by ezlibs main
```lua
local ezmemory = require('scripts/ezlibs-scripts/ezmemory')

local custom = {}

custom.on_tick = function (dt)
    print('custom plugin!')
end

return custom
```
